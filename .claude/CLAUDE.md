# GRIP — Claude Code Instructions

## Project Overview
GRIP is a Personal GRIP: a sovereign, locally-first personal web publishing space.
It is not a platform or product. It belongs to its owner alone.
Read `MANIFESTO.md` for the full philosophy.

## Core Principles (shape all technical decisions)
- **Local-first**: must run offline, no central service dependency
- **Simplicity over scale**: favor clarity and durability over clever abstractions
- **Immutable history**: past content is never silently rewritten or deleted
- **Human pace**: no feeds, no urgency, no engagement mechanics
- **Sovereignty**: owner controls everything — no third-party overrides

## Development Guidelines
- Prefer simple, standard tooling over complex frameworks
- Avoid dependencies that introduce vendor lock-in or phoning home
- No telemetry, analytics, or tracking of any kind
- Favor formats that will still be readable in 20 years (plain text, Markdown, HTML, SQLite)
- Do not over-engineer; build the minimum that satisfies the requirement

## Project Status
- Fresh repo, no source code yet
- Tech stack TBD

## gstack
- Use the `/browse` skill from gstack for all web browsing
- Never use `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools
- Available skills: `/office-hours`, `/plan-ceo-review`, `/plan-eng-review`, `/plan-design-review`, `/design-consultation`, `/review`, `/ship`, `/browse`, `/qa`, `/qa-only`, `/design-review`, `/setup-browser-cookies`, `/retro`, `/investigate`, `/document-release`, `/codex`, `/careful`, `/freeze`, `/guard`, `/unfreeze`, `/gstack-upgrade`

## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, ALWAYS invoke it using the Skill
tool as your FIRST action. Do NOT answer directly, do NOT use other tools first.
The skill has specialized workflows that produce better results than ad-hoc answers.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas, "is this worth building", brainstorming → invoke office-hours
- Bugs, errors, "why is this broken", 500 errors → invoke investigate
- Ship, deploy, push, create PR → invoke ship
- QA, test the site, find bugs → invoke qa
- Code review, check my diff → invoke review
- Update docs after shipping → invoke document-release
- Weekly retro → invoke retro
- Design system, brand → invoke design-consultation
- Visual audit, design polish → invoke design-review
- Architecture review → invoke plan-eng-review

## Design System
Always read DESIGN.md before making any visual or UI decisions.
All font choices, colors, spacing, and aesthetic direction are defined there.
Do not deviate without explicit user approval.
In QA mode, flag any code that doesn't match DESIGN.md.
